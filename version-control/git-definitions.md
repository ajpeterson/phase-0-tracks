# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the tracking of changes made to project files. It allows you to recall past versions of your work to aid in rolling back changes or fixing bugs. It also allows you to go back to a point in time to try out an alternate solution or code to see which one is best.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a stream of changes made to an existing project without affecting the master code. You can commit changes along the way to provide points to go back to if needed. Branches allow multiple users to work on the same project without getting in each others way and then merge the changes back to the master code file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point along a branch so you can easily go back in time to roll back changes made. These save points are committed locally. A good commit message is specific to the changes made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when Git cannot determine the changes to use since multiple users are committing changes to same the same portion of the project. In this case the merge conflict needs to be addressed locally and then the agreed upon changes pushed to Github.
