Plan to Learn Jquery

1. Find a good jquery cheat sheet to bookmark and use as a reference.

2. Review what I have already learned about jquery on Codecademy.
  - possibly finish the Codecademy tutorials depending on how much is left.

3. Research the most used jquery functions and see how I can start incorporate them.

4. Research other sites that provide examples and tutorials  for jquery.

5. Review 9.2 and previous js work from week 7 and see how jquery can be implemented in place of standard js.

* Take a 10-15 minute break after 1 hour and re-evaluate the plan to see if priorities need to be reset.


Results:
Finishing up the Codecademy tutorial on jquery was beneficial as I had previously completed about 80% of it. It was a great refresher and learning of some more commonly used jquery functions. Also, the research to find and bookmark a couple of cheat sheets was well worth it to have that information readily available.

Trying to find other tutorials did not prove to be to useful. However, applying jquery to the final release of the 9.2 pairing when we were trying to hide an element on a button click was quite useful and a good little test.
