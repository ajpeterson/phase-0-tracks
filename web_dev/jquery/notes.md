Plan to Learn Jquery

1. Find a good jquery cheat sheet to bookmark and use as a reference.

2. Review what I have already learned about jquery on Codecademy.
  - possibly finish the Codecademy tutorials depending on how much is left.

3. Research the most used jquery functions and see how I can start incorporate them.

4. Research other sites that provide examples and tutorials  for jquery.

5. Review 9.2 and previous js work from week 7 and see how jquery can be implemented in place of standard js.

* Take a 10-15 minute break after 1 hour and re-evaluate the plan to see if priorities need to be reset.
