9.1 Release 1: Web Servers

Key design philosophies of Linux:
Main philosophy is Linux is open source. So anyone can download, contribute updates and redistribute. The philosophy is based on the idea that the user knows what they are doing and are computer literate.

A VPS is a virtual machine(computer) that a user can access and use on the internet. It runs its own copy of an operating system.
  Advantages of using VPS:
    - More stability and reliability for basic web hosting needs
    - More control compared to shared hosting
    - Green technology, environmentally friendly and more efficient use of resources
    - Easy scalability when needed
    - Cost effective solutions for small websites

Running programs as the root user defeats the security that is in place to protect you. As the root user mistakes or bugs have the potential to devastate an entire system rather than just a few files.
